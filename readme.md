This is the most basic thing that could pass for an iperf3 server

It is incredibly primitive but it *does* work well enough to make iperf3 -c happy

I've started working on a better version of this [here](https://github.com/9names/iperf3-rs) but I'm keeping this one as a quick reference for how iperf3 works since this was not clear to me, despite reading the docs and the code.
